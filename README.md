## Functons 
### Definition of Funtion 
 A function is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.
 ### Function Declarations
 In Javascript one way to create a function is by using a function declarations, a function declaration binds a function to a name, or an identifier.
 A function declaration consist of :
 - The function keyword.
 - The name of the function, or its identifier, followed by parentheses.
 - A function body, or the block of statements required to perform a specific task, enclosed in the function’s curly brackets.
 #### For example 
 ```
 function greetWorld() {
  console.log('Hello, World!');
}

greetWorld(); // Output: Hello, World
```
### Calling a Function 
A function declaration does not ask the code inside the function body to run,  it just declares the existence of the function.The code inside a function body runs, or executes, only when the function is called. one can call function as many times it needed. 
#### For Example 
``` function sayThanks() {
  console.log('Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.')
}
sayThanks()
sayThanks()
sayThanks() 
```
#### Output
>- Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.
 - Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.
 - Thank you for your purchase! We appreciate your business.
### Parameters and Arguments 
#### Parameters 
Functions can take inputs and use the inputs to perform a task. While declaring a function, we can specify its parameters. Parameters allow functions to accept input(s) and perform a task using the input(s). We use parameters as placeholders for information that will be passed to the function when it is called.
#### Arguments
When calling a function that has parameters, we specify the values in the parentheses that follow the function name. The values that are passed to the function when it is called are called arguments. Arguments can be passed to the function as values or variables.
### For Example
```
function sayThanks(name) {
  console.log('Thank you for your purchase ' + name + '! We appreciate your business.');
}

sayThanks('Cole'); 
```
#### Output
> - Thank you for your purchase Cole!.
   - We appreciate your business.
